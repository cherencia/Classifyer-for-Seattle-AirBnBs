## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project I explore the Seattle's Airbnb dataset, which is available in Kaggle, you can download it from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.
The main purpose of this project is try to get some insights from the Airbnb rental market, which could be useful for people who already use this platform or is thinking about using for renting a property.
In order to do so, I asked my self the following questions, and tried subsequently to answer them using the dataset. The questions are:
1. The pricier the property listed, the better are the reviews?
2. Do owners of top-performance properties use different words from the rest in their descriptions?
3. Can we fit a classification model to the data ,with the purpose of predicting whether a rental is going to have a perfect rating?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is only one Jupyter notebook for this project, and it contains all the code necessary.
## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](http://datascience2go.nl/2020/05/a-machine-learning-model-to-detect-the-sexiness-of-an-airbnb-rental/).
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
